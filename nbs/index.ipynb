    "\n",
    "Langchain has native [tracing support](https://blog.langchain.dev/tracing/) that allows you to log runs.  This data is a valuable resource for fine-tuning and evaluation.  [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) is a commercial application that facilitates some of these tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, LangSmith may not suit everyone's needs.  It is often desirable to buid your own data inspection and curation infrastructure:\n",
    "\n",
    "> One pattern I noticed is that great AI researchers are willing to manually inspect lots of data. And more than that, **they build infrastructure that allows them to manually inspect data quickly.** Though not glamorous, manually examining data gives valuable intuitions about the problem.  The canonical example here is Andrej Karpathy doing the ImageNet 2000-way classification task himself.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">  -- [Jason Wei, AI Researcher at OpenAI](https://x.com/_jasonwei/status/1708921475829481683?s=20)\n",
    "\n",
    "`langfree` helps you export data from LangSmith and build data curation tools. By building you own data curation tools, so you can add features you need like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- connectivity to data sources beyond LangSmith.\n",
    "- customized data transformations of runs.\n",
    "- ability to route, tag and annotate data in special ways.\n",
    "- ... etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore,`langfree` provides a handful of [Shiny for Python](04_shiny.ipynb) components ease the process of creating data curation applications."

    "## FAQ\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **We don't use LangChain. Can we still use something from this library?** No, not directly.  However, we recommend looking at how the [Shiny for Python App works](tutorials/shiny.ipynb) so you can adapt it towards your own use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why did you use [Shiny For Python](https://shiny.posit.co/py/)?** Python has many great front-end libraries like Gradio, Streamlit, Panel and others.  However, we liked Shiny For Python the best, because of its reactive model, modularity, strong integration with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), and [WASM support](https://shiny.posit.co/py/docs/shinylive.html).  You can read more about it [here](https://shiny.posit.co/py/docs/overview.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Does this only work with runs from LangChain/LangSmith?**  Yes, `langfree` has only been tested with `LangChain` runs that have been logged to`LangSmith`, however we suspect that you could log your traces elsewhere and pull them in a similar manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Does this only work with [`ChatOpenAI`](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chat_models/langchain.chat_models.openai.ChatOpenAI.html) runs?** A: Yes, `langfree` is opinionated and only works with runs that use chat models from OpenAI (which use [`ChatOpenAI`](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chat_models/langchain.chat_models.openai.ChatOpenAI.html) in LangChain).  We didn't want to over-generalize this tool too quickly and started with the most popular combination of things.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Do you offer support?**: These tools are free and licensed under [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/parlance-labs/langfree/blob/main/LICENSE). If you want support or customization, feel free to [reach out to us](https://parlance-labs.com/).\n"
