    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Langchain has native [tracing support](https://blog.langchain.dev/tracing/) that allows you to log runs.  This data is a valuable resource for fine-tuning and evaluation.  [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) is a commercial application that facilitates some of these tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, LangSmith may not suit everyone's needs.  It is often desirable to buid your own data inspection and curation infrastructure so you can add your own features.\n",
    "\n",
    "> One pattern I noticed is that great AI researchers are willing to manually inspect lots of data. And more than that, **they build infrastructure that allows them to manually inspect data quickly.** Though not glamorous, manually examining data gives valuable intuitions about the problem.  The canonical example here is Andrej Karpathy doing the ImageNet 2000-way classification task himself.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">  -- [Jason Wei, AI Researcher at OpenAI](https://x.com/_jasonwei/status/1708921475829481683?s=20)\n",
    "\n",
    "`langfree` helps you export data from LangSmith and build data curation web applications.  The goal is to empower you to build you own data curation tools, so you can add features like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- connectivity to data sources beyond LangSmith.\n",
    "- customized data transformations of runs.\n",
    "- ability to route, tag and annotate data in special ways.\n",
    "- ... etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore,`langfree` provides a handful of [Shiny for Python](04_shiny.ipynb) components to make the process of creating data curation applications easier."
