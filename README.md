`langfree` helps you extract, transform and curate

runs from
[traces](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/how_to/logging_and_tracing)
stored in [LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith), which can be
used for fine-tuning and evaluation.

### Motivation

Langchain has native [tracing
support](https://blog.langchain.dev/tracing/) that allows you to log
runs. This data is a valuable resource for fine-tuning and evaluation.
[LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) is a commercial
application that facilitates some of these tasks.

However, LangSmith may not suit everyone’s needs. It is often desirable
to buid your own data inspection and curation infrastructure:

> One pattern I noticed is that great AI researchers are willing to
> manually inspect lots of data. And more than that, **they build
> infrastructure that allows them to manually inspect data quickly.**
> Though not glamorous, manually examining data gives valuable
> intuitions about the problem. The canonical example here is Andrej
> Karpathy doing the ImageNet 2000-way classification task himself.

`langfree` helps you export data from LangSmith and build data curation
web applications. By building you own data curation tools, so you can
add features you need like:

- connectivity to data sources beyond LangSmith.
- customized data transformations of runs.
- ability to route, tag and annotate data in special ways.
- … etc.

Furthermore,`langfree` provides a handful of [Shiny for
Python](04_shiny.ipynb) components to make the process of creating data
curation applications easier.
